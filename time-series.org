   14) Looking at the below ACF plot, would you suggest to apply AR or MA in ARIMA modeling technique?

 Modeling time series
 --------------------

- check acf and pacf
- Plot it and check if it is stationary
- can this series be modeled by AR or MA process? What is the order of AR or MA process
- If it is modeled as an AR model, check if it has unit roots using Arugmented ADF test
- Check if the series is not white noise (Mean = 0, SD = constant, Correlation between lags = 0). If it is white noise, we can't predict anything
  a) visual tests b)global vs local c) ACF and PACF plots
