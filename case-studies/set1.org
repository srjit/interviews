  Dashboard tracking metrics shows that average ETA is up by 3 minutes. How would you diagnose?

  Qns:
  - [*Clarify*]
    + ETA is generic. Time after making the request
     (To reach from the driver's current point to requester | Ride start to destination)
    + Is average ETA aggregated by hour or day

  - Check extreme values
    + Set a threshold (say 99% of values and check for extreme values) - Has data been collected
      correctly of technical issues
    + If there are no outliers we need to investigate further

  
  - [*Temporal Factor*]
    + Since when have we started noticing this change?
    + Sudden Increase - Has something changed in the algorithm?
    + Sudden Increase - Rider matching algorithm?
    + Progressive Increase -  
    
  - [*Segment by Region and Platform*]
    + Is it isolated to a particular region?
    + Is it isolated to a platform - Android/IOS
    + Special Event
    + Bad weather
