  - Let X and Y be normal random variables with their respective means 3 and 4 and variances 9 and 16, then 2X-Y will have normal distribution with parameters?
  - Suppose X and Y take values {0,1} and are independent with P(X=1)=1/2 and P(Y=1)=1/3. What is the probability that P(X+Y=1)

* T-Statistic

  Whenever you conduct a t-test, you will get a test statistic as a result.
  To determine if the results of the t-test are statistically significant, you can compare the test statistic to a
  T critical value.
  If the absolute value of the test statistic is greater than the T critical value,
  then the results of the test are statistically significant. \\

  Find critical value

  scipy.stats.t.ppf(q, df)

  where:

  q: The significance level to use
  df: The degrees of freedom
