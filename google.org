(1) How are you used to getting your data (Is data traditionally pulled for you? have you been involved in instrumenting logs? What software languages have you used for extraction?)


   I have been involved in projects where data was pulled by an engineering team and I have had to collect it myself. In certain cases I've collected part of data myself as well
   as from other teams.

   Python is the language that I use mainly for data collection. I've also used SQL/Vertica where the data was available in a relational way.

   

(2) What do you use to clean and/or analyze the data?

   Python (Pandas, NumPy, Beautifulsoup, Matplotlib, Plotly)

   

(3) What is the largest data set you've worked with in terms of parameters/fields?


(4) What would you consider to be your quantitative expertise and interest? (i.e. data mining, machine learning, time series analysis, experiment design, operations research etc.)


   My area of expertise is in data mining and processing. ////////\


   Please list your top 5 technical skills (programming languages, etc.) and rate each one as basic, intermediate or advanced.


(6) Do you now or any time in the future require visa sponsorship to work in the USA? Please elaborate.


(7) What are your top 2 location preferences?


(8) Do you have any timing pressures? Are you actively interviewing with other companies right now?
